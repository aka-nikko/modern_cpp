Custom Allocator

I want to design an application to process 10 recent transactions made by a user by fetching their details from the database.
OPERATION:
Each transactions amount, time and recepiant has to be printed to a log file.
NOTE: one transaction has no relatibility with others ie. all transactions are mutually exclusive.
Every transaction has following state
    transaction time | amount | source | destination
Container to use: Array

Example 01:
I want to design an application where a new data value is received at a fixed interval and gets added at the back of the data values so far. I want to process only the oldest value from these values at a time and print the value on the console.
I am not allowed to modify any received value and as a value gets processed, it needs to be removed from the transaction pending set.
Container to use: Queue


Data Structure - Arrangement of Data
Data Container - Use of Data Structure to provide featyres to user.

HASH VALUE or HASH:
The answer of a mathematical operation applied on the key.

HASH FUNCTION:
This is the operation applied.
Eg. MODULUS 5

HASH TABLE:
This is the table of content or a structure where postion of each key is preserved. 
The key is linked with the actual value.

[101 | Nikko | 60000.0f]
[102 | Anshul| 80000.0f]
[103 | Rohan | 80000.0f]
[104 | New   | 10000.0f]

HASH FUNCTION: MOD 3
====================
Step 01: Apply hash function on each key
    a. 101%3=2
    b. 102%3=0
    c. 103%3=1
    d. 104%3=2

HASH TABLE-
row 0--> [102 | [102 | Anshul| 80000.0f]]
row 1--> [103 | [103 | Rohan | 80000.0f]]
row 2--> [101 | [101 | Nikko | 60000.0f]] --> [104 | [104 | New   | 10000.0f]]
